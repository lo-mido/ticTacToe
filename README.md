# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is created as a practice project to reinforce programming concepts such as functions and loops.

## How to Play

1. **Open the Game**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.

2. **Game Board**: The game board consists of a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to mark a square with their symbol ("X" or "O").

3. **Winning**: The game is won by the first player to have three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

4. **Draw**: If the entire grid is filled with symbols and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game, including the grid and buttons.
  
- **CSS**: Styles the game board, symbols, and buttons to create a visually appealing interface.
  
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including functions to handle player turns, check for a winner, and update the game board.

## Implementation Details

- The game logic is implemented using JavaScript functions and loops.
  
- Event listeners are used to handle user interactions with the game board.
  
- The game checks for a winner after every move and displays a message when the game is over.

## Files Included

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the game, including the grid and buttons.
  
- **style.css**: Provides styles for the game elements, making it visually appealing.
  
- **script.js**: Implements the game logic using JavaScript, including functions and event listeners.

## Future Improvements

This project is a basic implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. Here are some ideas for future improvements:

- **Player Names**: Allow players to enter their names before starting the game.

- **Scoreboard**: Keep track of wins for each player in a scoreboard.

- **AI Opponent**: Implement a computer opponent using algorithms like Minimax for a more challenging game.

- **Animations**: Add animations for a more engaging user experience.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the game is playable on different devices and screen sizes.
